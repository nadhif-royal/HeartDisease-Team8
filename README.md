# HeartDisease-Team8
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC, and feature importance.
